## Canonical Matrix Product State (MPS)

Isometric Tensor Network State (isoTNS) is a generalization of canonical Matrix Product State (MPS).
For one-dimensional systems, their states can be written into an one-dimensional tensor network, namely, MPS.

Through SVD decomposition, any MPS can be turned to its canonical form with center $\ell$,
which is convenient for us to calculate site-$\ell$ expectation value.
Also, the center of canonical MPS can be moved to any site through a series of SVD decomposition.

## Isometry
Isometry is a property of maps.
Suppose that $A$ is a map
